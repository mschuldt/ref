Have you ever looked through the surplus catalogs arid wondered whether those 
memory core planes and stacks advertised could be used for anything other than tea strainers?
How are they supposed to work, and what kind of circuitry is required? Could you troubleshoot
and repair that surplus core memory and drive electronics? What good is a core stack without
data? Is it a worthwhile project to build a memory system around a core stack?
</p><p>
Some of these questions ran be answered directly in what follows. Others can be
answered at least partially in terms of my own experience: getting one surplus core stack to
work as the main memory of my home brew computer by building the necessary electronics
without the benefit of manufacturer's data.
</p><p>
Perhaps the biggest advantage of the core memory over other types of random access
memories is its ability to retain stored data when power is removed, and to have it readily
available when power is restored. This feature is sometimes used by minicomputer
manufacturers to ship their products with preloaded systems software. Also, for some
forms of core memory, the storage capacity increases much faster than the amount of
driving electronics. In order to understand the functional requirements and the operating
restrictions placed on core memory driving circuitry, it is necessary to
take a close look at how cores work, and how they are typically organized to form large
capacity stacks.
</p><p>

<b>Magnetic Fields and Hysteresis</b>
<br>
The memory storage element is the ferrite core itself. Its function is to accept, store, and
read out a bit of information. It can do this by virtue of its ferromagnetic properties. These
allow it to be easily, but strongly, magnetized in a preferred direction by an 
externally applied
magnetic field to signify a 1 bit value, to be easily magnetized in another direction 
to signify
a 0 bit value, and to retain its magnetic direction when the external field is removed.
</p><p>
Physically the core is a small doughnut shaped object made of pressed, heat treated,
nonconductive, iron oxide powder. A typical dimension Is 0.02 to
0.2 inches in diameter (0.5 to 5 mm). The external magnetic fields are applied to the core
by means of wires passing through it carrying controlled amounts of current.

core results from alignment of c structures with the
magnetic field due to current i.
</td></tr></tbody></table>


A straight wire carrying a current gives rise to a vector field, <b>H</b>, 
in the surrounding space, called the magnetic field strength. <b>H</b> is
proportional to the current i, and is a vector directed as shown in figure 1. The arrows
indicate the directions the north end of a compass needle would point if placed at the
points shown. Another vector quantity, the 

<!-- start page 7 ---->

magnetic field of induction, <b>B</b>, is also 
considered to exist, and describes the  overall magnetic effects due to <b>H</b>
 and the presence of matter. In figure 1, <b>B</b> behaves like <b>H</b>. If the
wire passes through a ferrite core, the <b>H</b> field generated by the wire causes 
molecular and microscopic sized magnetic domains (regions magnetized like the compass needle)
 in the core to align themselves in the direction of <b>H</b>,
resulting in a  <b>B</b> field In the core with direction
around the circumference of the core as shown in figure 2. This field is much stronger than
that due to the wire alone, because the
structures in the core add their fields to the wire field when aligned.

Figure 3: Memory properties are derived from the hysteresis properties of the 
core material. When the applied <b>H</b> value is 0, the residual <b>B</b> value in the core 
material will depend upon the past history o! magnetization. This figure and 
subsequent figures show the magnitude of the vector quantities <b>H</b> and <b>B</b>,
 with positive  and negative solves corresponding to the two directions of rotation 
about the core axis.
</td></tr></tbody></table>
</p><p>
Because of the geometry of the cores with respect to the wire, it is possible for us to drop
the vector notation and simply refer to the magnitude of <b>B</b> and <b>H</b> in the 
discussion which follows. The exact way the strength of  <b>B</b>in the
core depends on the strength of applied field <b>H</b> (proportional to current I) 
is represented graphically in the scalar <b>B</b> versus <b>H</b> curve of figure 3.

</p><p>
 After
manufacture, the core has no magnetization, and <b>B</b> = 0. 
If applied field <b>H</b> is increased from 0 to H<sub>p</sub>, <b>B</b> increases 
along path 0-1-c-e. If <b>H</b> decreases to 0, <b>B</b> decreases from e to b,
leaving the core magnetized with no applied field present. Decreasing <b>H</b> from 0 to 
<b>H<sub>m</sub></b> causes <b>B</b> to move along b-a-g-f, changing
direction as a passes through 0. As <b>H</b>
increases to 0, <b>B</b> moves to h, again leaving the
core magnetized with no applied field, but in a
direction opposite that above. As <b>H</b> increases
again from 0 to <b>H<sub>p</sub></b>. <b>B</b> moves along h-j-d-e.. If
<b>H</b> is again varied as described above, <b>B</b> will trace 
the same counter  clockwise path.
</p><p>

This effect of tracing two alternate paths
between two flied states, instead of tracing a
single path, is called hysteresis, In the core,



<!-- start page 8 --->





this is due to the alignment of the magnetic
domains, a process which requires a minimum
applied field to force alignment in a given
direction. When the applied field is removed, the
aligned structures provide the core with its own
field. Path segments a to g and j to d, where
this effect occurs, are termed irreversible.
Reversible magnetic effects also occur in the
core. For example, if <b>B</b> is at position h, <b>H</b> can
be varied to move <b>B</b> back and forth along line f-j  
as many times as desired as long as  B is
not increased past point j. Variations along line
a-e are also reversible to point a. This effect is
due to elastic deformation of the microscopic
structures and alignment of molecular
structures, both of which return to normal when
the applied field is removed. Both effects are
important: Hysteresis is  the memory property; 
reversibility, although the largest noise
contributor in the core, allows the core to act
as an AND gate, a key principle in selection of
individual bits.

Figure 4: Sense voltages perceived on a wire
.strung though the core depend upon the
previous <b>B</b> magnetization state in the core as
a current pulse is passed through the wire. 
A non-switching core produces a simple transient due to
reversible <b>B</b> field changes induced in the core
by the current edges as at (a). When the core
switches as at (b), an extra transient pulse is
induced in the sense wire.
</td></tr></tbody></table>
</p><p>


<b>Sensing Core Magnetism Changes</b>
<br>
Changes in the core <b>B</b> field are sensed by
means of a second wire passed through the
core. The voltage difference appearing at the
ends of the sense wire is proportional to the
change in <b>B</b>, and inversely proportional to the
time required for the change. So that an
irreversible change can produce a large signal.
<h>H is made to change as fast as possible,
However, this causes the reversible changes to
produce large signals also; but the speed tends
to separate the signals: Deformation 
effects can occur much more rapidly than
gross microscopic realignments, e.g.: for a
fast increase of <b>H</b> from 0 to <b>H<sub>p</sub></b> in figure 3, 
<b>B</b> would not follow h-i-d-e, but rather h-j-s-e,
so most reversible changes occur first. Figure
4 illustrates the voltages appearing across the
seine wire for a core in initial state b, and in
initial state h, resulting from a fast rising
current pulse generating field <b>H<sub>p</sub></b>.

Figure 5: Using the physics of core switching. This figure
shows the four basic operations needed to
manipulate the binary state of  a  core:
Read a "0", read a "1", write a "0", write a "1".
</td></tr></tbody></table>
</p><p>





<b>Using the Core to Remember</b>
<br>
	If we now interpret the initial direction of a
in the cores to represent a stored 0

(figure 4a) or a stored 1 (figure 4b), and read the
core contents by the method of figure 4, then
read and write operations can be performed a
indicated in figure 5. Two things should be
noted: First, a stored 1 is destroyed In the process
 of reading it because the core is reset to the
0 state. If it is necessary to retain the 1 in
memory for later use, a special refresh write
operation is required to restore the 1. Second,
the cases of writing into a core already
containing a 1 is not shown, because the
memory control logic is usually designed such
that a destructive read cycle always occurs
before the write cycle, for a given  core.
</p><p>
<b>Memories Larger Than One Bit</b>
<br>
Using the method of figure 5 can be an
expensive undertaking if one wants to store
4096 bits, for instance. Although the sense
line can be made to pass through all the cores
to detect switching of a selected care, circuitry
must be built which can select any one of 4096
cores and supply the proper read or write
current to it alone. To reduce the amount of
selection circuitry required

for large memories, the cores' reversibility
property is used to assist in the selection
process, This is done by passing two
independently controlled current lines instead of
just one through a given core; each line can
pass half the current of the original line. Due to
the shape of the <b>B</b> versus <b>H</b> curve, if only one
line passes half the required switching current
required, <b>B</b> remains in the reversible region and
returns to the original state (figure 6a) when
the current is removed. If both lines pass
current, core switching occurs if the  core is in
the proper original state (figure 6b and c).

Figure 6: How hysteresis makes coincident current bit selection possible. 
The principle involved is
simple: A current of i is sufficient to generate an H field strength which 
will drive the core from one store to the opposite state, 
but a current of i/2 is insufficient to cause the core to cross the
threshold of the hysteresis curve. The <b>H</b> field of two separate wires add,. 
that if two wires carry currents of i/2 in the same direction, 
the result is the some as a single  wire carrying a current of i.
The hysteresis curve at the right (d) shows the paths taken by the <b>B</b> field 
in the case of a single i/2 current (a), additive i/2 currents forcing a change (b), 
and additive. i/2  currents causing to change
since the core is already in a state aligned with the <b>H</b> field (c).

</td></tr></tbody></table>
</p><p>
<b>Coincidence Current Selection</b>
<br>
Thus by the means of coincident currents,
the core acts as an AND gate; both currents
need to be present simultaneously
to choose the core and allow it to switch
if it is in the proper state. A multiple bit
memory can now be constructed as shown in
figure 7.
If currents are applied to lines X2 and Y3, the
core at (2,3) is selected. Other cores on the lines
X2 and Y3 are half selected. Only
one pair of lines is allowed to carry current at
any one time. To read the core contents  
at (2,3), current is passed as indicated. To

now write a 1, the current is reversed; to write
a 0, no current is applied.
</p><p>

<b>Property and Operation Restrictions</b>
<br>Arrangement of cores in the coincidence
current mode imposes so rather severe
requirements on core fabrication and memory
operating conditions. For a core in <b>B</b> state x in
figure 8, the half select current must generate
a field less than Hk to prevent <b>B</b> from passing
the "knee" of the curve. But the tool select
current must generate a field greater than <b>Hs</b>
to ensure full switching of the core. Thus the
half select current can only produce fields in
the range shown by the heavy line. As the
quantity (<b>Hs</b> - <b>Hk</b>) gets smaller, the operating
range gets larger. So the cores are made with
(<b>Hs</b> - <b>Hk</b>) as small as possible, but even if it
were zero, the half select current would have;
maximum tolerance of 33% of its midrange
value. The operating range is further restricted
by two more factors. First, manufacturing and
assembly tolerances allow memories to be
constructed of cores with slightly differing <b>B</b>
versus <b>H</b> curves, effectively increasing the
difference (<b>Hs</b> - <b>Hk</b>) as all cores are
considered. Second, as the memory is
operated, the cores heat up due to switching
losses, select line heat, and heat from nearby
electronics, causing the entire <b>B</b> versus <b>H</b> curve
to shrink towards the origin. Newer core
memories me made using ferrite with low
temperature sensitivity; but this is not true of
older memories, and such measures as
constant temperature ovens, forced air cooling,
and power supply temperature compensation
have been used to ensure reliable operation. ,
</p><p>
<b>Reading and Writing Words: The 3D Memory</b>
<br>The coincidence current scheme certainly
cuts down the required selection circuitry,
although at the expense of operating
tolerances. The 20 cores of figure  7 are
selected by nine lines, and the 4096 bit
memory mentioned earlier, if arranged in a 64
X 64 array, has only 128 select lines. Further
economy is realized if the idea is expanded to
word organized memories. For example,
consider the 16 bit array of figure 9 which has
an added winding - the inhibit line (the arrows on
the select lines indicate the read current
directions). If a 16 word memory of 3 bits per
word is desired, three of these bit planes are
interconnected as shown in figure 10.
</p><p>
Sending half select currents through X1
and Y1 select lines in the arrow directions will
cause the core at (1 ,1) in each array to read
out via the associated array sense line.
Reversing the select current directions will

Figure 7: The concept of a coincident current selection is implemented 
using an array of cores with X and Y lines. in this example, a total of 20 cores is 
wired with a single sense wire, 4 Y selection wires and 5 X selection wires. 
When i/2 (see figure 6) is flowing through one X and one Y line, the matrix 
intersection point is addressed. In this example, the care et (2,3) will either be read 
or written. Actual core arrays are much larger than this simple conceptual

cause a 1 to be written in each (1,1) position.
In order to write a 0 in some of the (1,1)
positions, a half select current is also applied to
the desired inhibit lines in the direction of the
arrows at the time 1's are to he written. This
inhibit current appears as read half select
current at all cores of the dated array,
canceling half the write select current at the
selected core, and thus preventing the writing

<p>
For a 4 K word memory of 16 bit words,
the assembly (called a stack since the arrays
are often stacked like pancakes for simple
interconnection along the edges) would have
128 select lines, 16 sense lines, and 16 inhibit
lines. The connection scheme is termed 3D,
3D, and is most economical in terms of
support  circuitry.
</p><p>
<b>Other Arrangements</b>
<br>
Bit oriented memories of the form of figure
7 are called 2D memories. Another commonly used
word oriented connection scheme, 2-1/2D, will
not be discussed because of the relatively large
amount of select circuitry used. Interested
readers are referred to the bibliography at the
end of this article. A variation of the 3D
memory replaces the inhibit and sense lines by
a single line which performs both functions,
since they occur at separate times. At the
cost of additional circuit complexity, the variation allows
small. cores and more closely packed arrays
to be used.
</p><p>
<b>Minimizing the Noise</b>
<br>
A core can be oriented two ways at a
select line intersection, and sense and inhibit

lines	string the cores of a plane in many
patterns. Advantage is taken of these facts to
minimize noise from sources which could
otherwise mask the sense line signal due to
core switching. Major noise contributors are
pulses from half selected core, (path a
figure 6d). Although small for a single core, the
composite signal due to 126 half selected cores
in a 4 K array will spread and totally mask a
switching signal. A diagonal pattern that results
in almost complete cancellation of half select
pulses is shown in figure 11a. Noise is also
generated through capacitive coupling between
select and sense lines, allowing select current
edges to induce ringing in the  sense line. This
effect can be minimized by running the sense
line parallel to one select line direction as shown
in figure 11b. The parallel select line is turned
on first, a large noise pulse is induced which
dies down, then the other line is turned on to
select the core. Little noise is now generated
because capacitive coupling is small.
</p><p>
There arc other lesser noise effects which
make the 4096 core array about the largest
to be practically  saved by a single sense line.
Larger stack word capacities are realized by
using multiple sense lines on each plane, thus
requiring additional sense circuitry.
</p><p>
<b>Driving the 3D Memory</b>
<br>
The half select current tolerances mentioned in
connection with figure 8 are further reduced to
less than 20% per line by the addition of the
inhibit line. Unfortunately the amplitude of the
core switch signal depends on the total select
current

present, so the select current must be
maintained at the higher allowed values to
obtain a favorable signal to noise ratio on the  
sense line. This reduces current to tolerance
around 5% to 10%. Depending on the type of
cores used, half select currents arc in the
range of 150 to 500 mA. Current

rise time of the last select line turned on (to
read) should be about half the core design time
for a 1 peak (figure 4b) to occur, which ranges
from 100 nanoseconds to about a microsecond for
older large diameter cores. Current should last

<b>Getting a Memory to Work 
<br>(Starting from Scratch)
</b>
<br>
My surplus Spectra 70 stack (built by
Electronic Memories, In, ) arrived with no
information except that its organization was
128 x 136 words x 18 bits with four sense line
groups of 64 x 68 words. Of that 1 intended to
initially use a 64 x 64 word x 16 bit segment.
Not being able to obtain manufacturer's data, I
proceeded to discover the stack characteristics
for myself. For readers
similar situations. I would recommend such
a course of action only if you have lots of
spare time, like surprises, and have access to
a 15 MHz dual trace scope.
</p><p>
The physical dimensions of the stack were
5 by 5 by 3 inches (12.7 by 12.7 by 7.6 cm)
not counting connectors. Tamper proof, auto
destruct construction precluded
a view of cores or windings. X and Y lines
were labeled; an ohmmeter was used to associate
sense and inhibit connector pins to core planes.
Memory construction suggested the
rectangular winding of figure 116.
</p><p>
<b>Tests</b>
<br>
Several test circuits were built to determine core
switching characteristics. Figure
12 shows the select line driver circuit, two of
which are required to drive an X and a Y line.
The Texas Instruments Memory Core Driver
integrated circuit (SN75325) is used. The
external diodes simulate the steering diodes
required to select more than one line, and to
direct reverse voltages (generated at current
turn off time by the inductive load of the select
lines) to the sink transistor collector which is
internally diode clamped to source voltage Vs.
Vs is regulated and variable over about a 5
volts range, and R1 is chosen fur the current
rang, to be tried. Figure 13 shows the inhibit
driver circuit. The dual gates of the integrated
circuit are connected in parallel to increase the
current sinking capacity. Again the output must
be diode clamped, and R2 is chosen as
required. Figure 14a shows the sense amplifier
with terminating resistors and means for
varying the threshold voltage. The sense
amplifier operates by generating an internal
voltage proportional to the voltage difference
appearing on the sense line wire pair. This
voltage is compared with the adjustable

<!-- start page 13 ---->

threshold reference voltage, and a TTL high
level output is generated If the threshold is
exceeded. Figure 14b illustrates the outputs
produced at two threshold levels for an
arbitrary input signal.
</p><p>
Timing signals used are shown in figure 15
along with resulting current directions. The
logic diagram illustrates a circuit which tan be
used to generate this timing. The enveloping of
X ENABLE and Y ENABLE eliminates part of
the half select noise in the read cycle, and
ensures that the inhibit current is at maximum
level when full write selection takes place.
Repetition rate of the memory cycle during
testing is kept under 1 kHz to prevent damage
to the SN75325s. Changing the mode,
WRITE, with both enable signals low ensures
that a glitch will not short current through a
directly connected source to sink pair.
</p><p>
Two select line drivers were connected to
an arbitrary select line pair, and the sense
amplifier was connected to a sense line thought
to pass through the X Y intersection. With no
signals to the select line drivers, the sense
amplifier threshold voltage was advanced from
zero until SENSE OUT was a steady logic 0.
Starting with a low (about 150 MA) half select
current, the line drivers were started, and, with
the sense  amplifier output monitored on
the oscilloscope, the threshold voltage, was
adjusted to show a series of spikes
corresponding to select current edges as
shown in figure 16a. As half select currents
were increased equally, additional pulses
emerged after spikes numbered 3 and 11, as
indicated by the arrows in figure 16a. These
pulses indicated core switching. Some
experimenting was required to obtain proper
select current balance and  strength, which
occurs when the switching pulses completely
disappear (and not just shift) when either half
select current is temporarily interrupted. Too
much drive current was also indicated by a
decrease in size of the switching purses with
corresponding pulses appearing behind spikes
number 1 and 9.
</p><p>
Choosing inhibit drive resistor R2 to provide
half select current in the range determined
necessary above, the inhibit line corresponding
to the sense line used was found by driving an
inhibit current through each inhibit line in turn
until the switching pulses were seriously
disturbed. Further adjustments of the inhibit,
X, and Y currents eventually resulted in the
switching pulse appearing and disappearing as
the inhibit current is turned off and on. In my
memory stack, about 390 to 400 mA half
select current is required to cause the core to
switch, producing a sense amplifier output

address (low order bits 0 and 1). 
X READ ENABLE equals X ENABLE AND NOT WRITE;
X WRITE ENABLE equals X ENABLE AND WRITE. 
By extension of this scheme (see the
TI catalog listed in the bibliography), 16 source
to sink pairs are required to select one of 64 X
lines. I found that a single source resistor (R1
of figure 12) could service all source transistors
used to select X service all source transistors
used to select X drive lines, which eliminated
the necessity of matching resistor values to
provide the same current flow as different lines
are selected. Two 3 to 8 decoders use six
address hits to enable two source to sink pairs.
The above circuitry is duplicated for the 64 Y
lines, thus a 12 bit address is decoded into
unique X Y intersection of the core matrix. A
total of 16 SN75325 integrated circuits and 4
decoders are required, along with diode arrays.
Three independently regulated and variable
supply voltages were provided to allow
adjustment of X, Y, and inhibit currents. Inhibit
drive resistors (R2 of figure 13) must be
closely matched m allow operation from a
common supply voltage.

Figure 16.: Sense Amplifier Output. Spikes will be seen in the sense 
amplifier outputs following current changes through the cores. Detection of a "0" or 
"1" is obtained by observing or the "read strobe point" which follows the leading 
edge of the X enable pulse. This observation point is typically 400
seconds offer the leading edge of the X enable pulse which drives one of the
X select lines.

Figure 18 illustrates control and data flow of
the memory logic. Read data is
stored, by means  of the Read Strobe signal, a
buffer where it is used for restoring the
memory word in a central processor read
operation. In a central processor write operation,
 this read information is ignored and
data from the CPU controls the inhibit
drivers during memory writing. Timing is of
the form of figure 15, except that the 
memory cycle (read then write) is accelerated
to 8 microseconds in my system. Inhibit and
sense circuits are similar to those of figures 13 and 14a.
<p>
The arrangement of figure 18 is wasteful of
central processor time, because data and
address information must be held until the
memory cycle is completed. Buffering data and
address information in the memory logic would
allow the processor to continue after





Figure 18: System diagram of a memory built according to the principles 
described In this article. The basic memory cycle is set up by a circuit 
such as the one shown in figure 15 as a
source of timing control. In a read cycle, data is first read, then 
rewritten; in a write cycle, old data is
read and new data written.



issuing a write command, or to wait for only
half the memory cycle for data needed by a
read operation.
</p><p>
	The memory is coarsely adjusted by
electronically forcing repeated manual write
cycles through the processor's control panel.
This allows adjustment of the halt select and
inhibit currents, sense amplifier thresholds,
and read strobe.		The read strobe point is
adjusted to occur at the point of sense
amplifier output that provides best discrimination 
between 0 and 1 levels (see
figure 16b).  Short program loops can then
be used to make finer adjustments.

<b>Conclusion</b>
<br>
Recently completed, the 4096 x 16 memory
subsystem described here was built for less
than $400, including stack, power supplies, and
miscellaneous electronic and mechanical parts;
and can be expanded to 16 K for about $200.
In most of the memory, storage reliability is
good; although a few blocks of addresses tend
to pick up random bits. Bugs have been
eliminated in a straight forward manner, most
having been Paced to poorly made connections
to select lines and to a bad batch of inhibit
driver integrated circuits. Building a memory

around a core stack is an interesting but time
consuming project that can definitely result in a
usable end product. As with many surplus
items however, performance depends a lot on
how much you can find out about the stack,
and on the hardware design concessions that
have to be made in the interest of financial solvency.
